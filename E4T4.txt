# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

- VPC endpoints to access S3 resources
- Encrypt EC2 volumnes
- Configure AWS System Manager rather than through SSH
- Route 53 and CloudFront for addtional request filter and hardening

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
No. VPC private endpoints with IAM still allows IAM permissions that have been set. 
IAM permissions need to update for this case.


# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No.
Existing files / objects are not encrypted. We will need to reupload those files again.


# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

All the changes that have been done will be reset.
Cloud formation template should be updated and maintained.

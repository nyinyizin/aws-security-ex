# Text file identifying 2 poor security practices with justification.


# 1 - Poor Security Practice for Web Service Instance

WebAppSG security group allows traffic from any IP and any Ports without any restriction. That's lead to the wide open for attackers.
WebAppSG security group should only allows the traffic from the load balancer only.
And WebAppSG outbound rules should be updated to limit the internet access using NAT Gatway 
or create vpc endpoint to consume S3 resources rather than going through via internet.
We Service Instance should be moved to Private Subnet and Application Load Balancer will act as Bastin Host.
IAM role for instace is unrestricted and it's currently allowed all the permissions and repository in S3



# 2 - Poor Security Practice for S3

Public access for both buckets has enabled.
IAM role with limited access should be there for both buckets.
And limit the access of buckets.
Web Service Instace's IAM role should only access Free Recipes bucket with limited permissions

- Restrict the ports that are not in use, port 80 to Load Balancer and 5000 for Web Service Instance
- Encryption in S3 buckets
- Restrict the public access of S3 buckets, all IAM user or Role should limit access to their respective repo only

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
- Access EC2 instances via AWS System Manager rather than via SSH with key in local or other machines.
- Encrypt EC2 volumnes

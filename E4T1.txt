# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
1# Disabled the password login for Web Service Instance. Only allow key based login
2# Moved the Web Service Instance to Private subnet and block the ports and unnecessary incoming flows.

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
1# Create a least priviledge role for Web Service Instance.
2# Only "Priviledge Business Users" IAM user group should only have access to Secrete Recipe Vault bucket.
